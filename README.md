# ⛓️ Simple Blockchain Implementation (Java)

A foundational blockchain project implemented in Java. This project demonstrates the core principles behind blockchain technology, including block creation, cryptographic hashing, and chain validation. It is designed as an educational tool to understand the mechanics of a blockchain in a simple, easy-to-follow way.

---

## ✨ Features

* Block creation with data, timestamp, and cryptographic hash
* Blocks linked through previous block hash to form a chain
* Chain validation to ensure integrity
* Object oriented Java implementation for clarity and modularity

---

## 🛠 Requirements

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
* A Java IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code) or command line environment

---

## 🚀 How to Start

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kashbyte/Blockchain.git
```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE
3. Compile and run the main class, typically found in the `noobchain` folder

From the command line:

```bash
javac *.java
java Main
```

---

## ▶️ How to Use

Once running, the program will:

1. Create the first block (genesis block)
2. Add additional blocks with example data
3. Print the blockchain and validation results to the console

You can modify the data in each block or extend the functionality to explore blockchain behavior.

## 📚 What This Project Teaches

* Core blockchain concepts: block structure, hashing, and chain validation
* How cryptographic hashes link blocks securely
* Object oriented programming principles in Java
* The basics of data integrity in distributed systems

---

## 💡 Possible Improvements

* Implement proof of work (mining) to secure the chain
* Add peer-to-peer networking for a decentralized chain
* Introduce wallets and transactions
* Persist the blockchain to a file or database
* Modularize the code for reuse as a library

## 🧠 Notes

This project represents my initial hands-on experience with blockchain technology. It helped me understand how blocks are linked and secured using hashes, providing a solid foundation for more advanced blockchain and decentralized application development. Revisiting this project highlights my growth from basic concepts to building scalable systems in modern programming environments.
